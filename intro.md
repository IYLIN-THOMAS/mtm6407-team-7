# Story Introduction

It was a chilly December morning, and 10-year-old Kevin woke up to an eerily silent house. The usual chaos of his bustling family was nowhere to be found. He dashed from room to room, calling out, "Mom? Dad? Anyone?" But all he heard was the echo of his voice bouncing off the walls.

Kevin realized the truth: his family had left for their holiday trip... and forgotten him at home!

At first, he felt the thrill of freedom. No one to tell him to clean up, eat vegetables, or go to bed early. But that excitement quickly turned to concern when he spotted two shady figures loitering near the driveway. Kevin overheard their whispers about "hitting the jackpot" with an empty house.

He knew what he had to do.

What will Kevin do next?
