# Setting Up Traps

Kevin wasted no time. He grabbed his dadâ€™s toolbox, some string, and a box of marbles. His plan was simple but effective: make the house a fortress of booby traps.

He set up a bucket of ice water above the front door, scattered marbles in the hallway, and rigged the stairs with a tripwire. His favorite trap was a glue-covered doormat near the living room.

As Kevin stood back to admire his work, he heard the sound of the front gate creaking open. The intruders were making their move.

Kevin held his breath, waiting. The first intruder stepped onto the doormat and was instantly stuck. Panicking, he tried to step back but slipped on the marbles, crashing into the wall. The second intruder, distracted by the noise, tripped on the tripwire and tumbled down the stairs. They both scrambled to the door, but as they reached it, the bucket tipped, dousing them with ice-cold water. Soaked and defeated, they bolted, leaving Kevin to enjoy his victory in peace.
