# Setting Up Traps

Kevin wasted no time. He grabbed his dadâ€™s toolbox, some string, and a box of marbles. His plan was simple but effective: make the house a fortress of booby traps.

He set up a bucket of ice water above the front door, scattered marbles in the hallway, and rigged the stairs with a tripwire. His favorite trap was a glue-covered doormat near the living room.

As Kevin stood back to admire his work, he heard the sound of the front gate creaking open. The intruders were making their move.
