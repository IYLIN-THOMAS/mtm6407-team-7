## Calling for Backup
Kevin knows he can't handle this alone. He sneaks into his dad’s study, finds the family’s emergency phone, and dials the number for his eccentric Uncle Jim, a retired police officer who lives nearby.

Uncle Jim, thrilled at the prospect of some action, tells Kevin to stay hidden. Moments later, he arrives, armed with a flashlight and a very large dog named Duke. Together, they scare off the burglars, who weren’t prepared for such a dramatic showdown. Kevin learns the value of asking for help when it’s needed.
