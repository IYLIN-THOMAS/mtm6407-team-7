# A Clever Distraction

Kevin, ever the inventive thinker, realized he needed to buy more time. Using an old remote-controlled car, some sparklers, and a roll of duct tape, he fashioned a decoy. The plan? Distract the intruders long enough for his Uncle Jim and Duke to arrive.

Kevin lit the sparklers, taped them to the car, and sent it zooming toward the burglars, who were now fumbling around the living room. Startled by the sudden light and movement, they panicked, chasing the car as it zipped around furniture, knocking over lamps and scattering their tools.

Hiding in the shadows, Kevin couldn’t help but chuckle as the intruders fell right into his trap. The distraction worked perfectly—Uncle Jim burst through the door with Duke just as the burglars were cornered by the mischievous RC car.

The crooks surrendered immediately, and Kevin learned that even the smallest distractions can make a big impact when executed at the right time.
