# Searching the Burglars' Belongings  
As Uncle Jim dealt with the burglars, Kevin’s curiosity got the better of him. He noticed a suspicious-looking bag the burglars had left behind. Inside, he found blueprints of other homes in the neighborhood, a set of lockpicking tools, and a strange map marked with an "X."  

Realizing this could be important evidence, Kevin handed the bag to Uncle Jim. The retired officer praised Kevin’s bravery and quick thinking, ensuring him that the authorities would investigate further.  

Kevin felt a sense of pride, knowing he had not only defended his home but also helped prevent future burglaries.
