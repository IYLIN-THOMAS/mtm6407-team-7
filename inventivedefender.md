# The Inventive Defender
Kevin, an avid fan of spy movies and DIY projects, decides to turn the house into a fortress. Armed with his creativity and household items, he sets up booby traps. Flour bombs, marbles on the floor, and a cleverly rigged sprinkler system await the intruders.

When the burglars break in, chaos ensues. Kevin watches from his hiding spot as his traps turn the criminals into a laughingstock. Covered in paint, slipping on butter, and soaked to the bone, they finally flee, swearing to avoid that house forever.

Kevin grins, proud of his victory, and uses his parents' emergency contact list to call for help.
